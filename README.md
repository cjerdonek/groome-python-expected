<!-- All Markdown comments are in the format of one-line HTML comments -->
<!-- to simplify the conversion of Markdown to reST.  We strip comments -->
<!-- of this form prior to passing the file to pandoc because pandoc -->
<!-- preserves HTML and PyPI rejects reST long descriptions containing -->
<!-- HTML. -->

<!-- TODO: add a placeholder image. -->

<!-- TODO: check that this link renders nicely in both HTML and reST. -->
<!-- Also compare with the image markup used in the Molt project README. -->

This project is what you get when you render the
[Groome](http://cjerdonek.github.com/groome) template
[groome-python](https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome-python) with its
sample configuration file.

[This project and `groome-python` are still being worked on and are not
yet usable.]
