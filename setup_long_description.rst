This is the working skeleton project you get when you render the
`Groome <http://cjerdonek.github.com/groome>`_ template
`groome-python <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome-python>`_ with its
sample configuration file.

[This project and ``groome-python`` are still being worked on and are
not yet usable.]

This section describes how to modify and contribute to Pizza. In
particular, it shows you the way around and how to interact with Pizza
from a source checkout.

To run the main ``pizza`` script from source:

::

    $ python runpizza.py tomatoes garlic
    input: tomatoes, garlic

This script is essentially a development convenience for running:

::

    $ python -m pizza.scripts.pizza ...

which is in turn equivalent to the command above that To get help and
see all options:

::

    $ python runpizza.py --help

To run project tests (which are already stubbed out):

::

    $ python runpizza.py --run-tests

For Maintainers
---------------

See the module docstring of ``setup.py`` for instructions on preparing
and pushing new versions to PyPI.
