|Build Status|

`Pizza <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome-python-expected>`__ is a
sample demonstration project of a `Python <http://www.python.org>`__
command-line script.

Pizza is the project you get when you render the
`Groome <http://cjerdonek.github.com/groome>`__ project template
`groome-python <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome-python>`__ with its
sample configuration file. For testing purposes, this project also
serves as the "expected" value of that template. See the
`groome-python <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome-python>`__ project
page for features of this project.

A minimal sample usage looks like--

::

    $ python runpizza.py hello crazy world
    3

The project page and source code is on
`GitHub <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome-python-expected>`__, and
releases can be found on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pizza>`__
(the Python Package Index).

Feedback is welcome. You can file bug reports and feature requests on
the `project
tracker <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome-python-expected/issues>`__.

[This project and ``groome-python`` are still being worked on and are
not yet usable.]

Requirements
------------

Pizza supports the following Python versions:

-  Python 2.7
-  Python 3.2
-  Python 3.3
-  `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`__

Pizza has no third-party dependencies.

Installing for Python 3 requires that
`Distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`__ be installed and
that `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`__ use Distribute.

TODO [template]: merge this section with the "For Contributors" section.
We may want to move this information to developing.md.

This section describes how to modify and contribute to Pizza. In
particular, it shows you the way around and how to interact with Pizza
from a source checkout.

To run the main ``pizza`` script from source:

::

    $ python runpizza.py tomatoes garlic
    input: tomatoes, garlic

This script is essentially a development convenience for running:

::

    $ python -m pizza.scripts.pizza ...

which is in turn equivalent to the command above that To get help and
see all options:

::

    $ python runpizza.py --help

To run project tests (which are already stubbed out):

::

    $ python runpizza.py --run-tests
